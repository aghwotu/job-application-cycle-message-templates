`Here’s an example of what a good DM on LinkedIn looks like:`

“Hi Rohan,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me. I am Vegeta, a second year MS student at Beerus university. Prior to grad school, I worked as a Sr. Software Engineer at Planet Kai. My projects during this time involved working on highly transactional cloud based services which taught me how to tradeoff scale and performance. I have also worked on project foo-bar that taught me Identity Management and Access control. I feel that this combination will add value to your M365 Core Security Team, which, as I understand from the white paper you published recently, works at the exciting intersection of core infra tech and massive cloud services at scale.

I have also done two Product Management internships at Namek as well as worked on Customer Acquisition Strategies at a startup in India along with a couple of friends. These taught me how to understand and interpret customers and really translate their needs and pain points as users into business requirements. I also learned how to drive clarity from ambiguity; an important skill for any PM.

I am very interested in the Product Management opportunity on your team at Microsoft. If your schedule permits, can you please help me understand a little more about the roles and responsibilities.”
