Here’s an example of what a good DM on LinkedIn looks like:

> ```text

“Hi Rohan,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me. I am Vegeta, a second year MS student at Beerus university. Prior to grad school, I worked as a Sr. Software Engineer at Planet Kai. My projects during this time involved working on highly transactional cloud based services which taught me how to tradeoff scale and performance. I have also worked on project foo-bar that taught me Identity Management and Access control. I feel that this combination will add value to your M365 Core Security Team, which, as I understand from the white paper you published recently, works at the exciting intersection of core infra tech and massive cloud services at scale.

I have also done two Product Management internships at Namek as well as worked on Customer Acquisition Strategies at a startup in India along with a couple of friends. These taught me how to understand and interpret customers and really translate their needs and pain points as users into business requirements. I also learned how to drive clarity from ambiguity; an important skill for any PM.

I am very interested in the Product Management opportunity on your team at Microsoft. If your schedule permits, can you please help me understand a little more about the roles and responsibilities.”

## Following up on a Job Application

Following up when:

### You've just sent your Resume and Cover letter but haven't received a response after a week or more

From Indeed, ['How To Write a Follow-Up Email After Submitting Your Application'](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/follow-up-email-after-application)

> Unless the job posting has indicated a specific timeline for the hiring process, it's generally appropriate to send a follow-up email one to two weeks after you’ve applied. This allows employers sufficient time to review your resume, cover letter and any other materials you have included. If you’re [following up after an interview](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/follow-up-email-examples-after-interview), it is appropriate to follow up more quickly—after three to five days.

### Email or LinkedIn followup after interview with recruiter

Here you've had a chat or call with the recruiter and received the go-ahead to send your resume which your promptly did but you haven't heard back.

Yesterday I received yet another "We're sorry, we chose another candidate, etc etc..." I replied back with this:

I'd like to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to interview and consideration for the Graphic Design position.

I'm sorry to hear that the decision did not go my way, but appreciate that the decision was a difficult one. I appreciate the care and thoroughness shown to me during my interview. I'm impressed with your company, the way it conducts business, and it was a pleasure meeting the whole team. I sincerely hope that sometime in the future we get an opportunity to work together, and kindly ask that you keep me in mind should any position arise in the future.

I wish you and your team great success. Thank you again for your time and consideration. Please kindly pass my gratitude to the rest of the team.

Best Regards,

Dear Ms. Jenson,

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly to let me know I haven’t been accepted for the Junior Copyeditor position. I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about what Bermont Books is all about and its mission of sustainability.

While I’m disappointed I didn’t get the role, I hope you’ll keep me on file for any future positions that you feel would match my skill set and experience level.

If you have any advice about my interview performance or supporting documents that could help improve my candidacy in the future, I would appreciate hearing it from someone with your expertise.

Thanks again for taking the time to consider my application.

Sincerely,
Jenny Henderson
